â”œâ”€â”€ main.jsx           # React entry point
â””â”€â”€ index.css          # Base styles
```

## Adding New Problems

To add new problems, edit `src/data/problems.json` following this structure:

```json
{
  "id": 6,
  "title": "Problem Title",
  "difficulty": "Easy|Medium|Hard",
  "topic": "Array, Hash Table, etc.",
  "description": "Problem description...",
  "algorithm": {
    "approach": "Algorithm name",
    "steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "..."],
    "timeComplexity": "O(n)",
    "spaceComplexity": "O(1)"
  },
  "code": {
    "language": "javascript",
    "solution": "function solution() { ... }"
  },
  "examples": [
    {
      "input": "Input example",
      "output": "Expected output",
      "explanation": "Why this works"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Sample Problems Included

The website comes with 5 sample problems covering different difficulty levels:

1. **Two Sum** (Easy) - Hash Table approach
2. **Amazon Fresh Promotion** (Medium) - Two Pointers technique
3. **Critical Connections** (Hard) - Graph algorithms with DFS
4. **Package Delivery** (Medium) - Greedy algorithms
5. **Minimum Window Substring** (Hard) - Sliding Window technique

## Customization

### Styling
- Edit CSS variables in `src/App.css` to change the color scheme
- Modify component styles in individual CSS files
- The design uses a mobile-first responsive approach

### Adding Features
- Search filters can be extended in `ProblemList.jsx`
- New problem properties can be added to the JSON structure
- Additional tabs can be added to `ProblemCard.jsx`
